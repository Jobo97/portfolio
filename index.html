    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Sammamish, Washington where my family had recently moved for my Fathers work.<br>
        He now has been working for Abode my whole life and has inspired me to seek the same profession.<br>
        I live for sports and competition of any kind as I feel it brings out the best of each side whlie<br>
        trying to acheive a common goal. If you'd like to chat about the NFL, NBA, MLS, MLB or even Hockey,<br>
        please contact me below!<br>
      </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>My experience with programing began with CS 142 at BYU in 2018. Since then I have completed a few projects such as:
        <ul class='list'>
          <li><b>Image editor:</b> With the input of an image, my project could distort/flip/monochrome it as desired</li>
          <li><b>Evil Hangman:</b> This game is programmed to never let the player win, as it cheats to not allow a correct guess until it has to.</li>
          <li><b>Family Search:</b> This App allows the user to input family history into a server and view on a map their own heritage!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I have been working for over a year at Brigham Young University in their Continuing Education division.<br>
        In this division, I am the lead corrections manager where I fix errors inside of our LMS's to allow <br>
        students to continue in their learning. This involves coding in HTML and CSS mainly to fix test questions and<br>
        banks.
